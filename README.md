# docker-waffle-ng ![](https://travis-ci.org/Husterknupp/docker-waffle-ng.svg?branch=master "travis build status")

List docker repos as seen on Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/explore/). Also text search should be possible. Backend should talk to public docker hub api.

npm start

### prod mode (dist folder)
npm run build

*ideas*
Connect component to en.wikipedia entry | make wiki text available in search | show only list of containers on app startup and load single card on app click
